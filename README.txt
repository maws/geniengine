Welcome to the official GeniEngine repository. 

GeniEngine is a simple game engine based on open source code, feel free to clone/fork. The current framework will not compile on any platform but windows, yet.

This is not a stable branch.

Requirements
============

You need to have C and C++ compilers installed and functioning. The only compiler tested so far is MSVC.
